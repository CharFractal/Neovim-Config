# My Neovim Config Repository
## For coding in C and C++

Welcome to my Neovim Config repository!, its configured for C and c++ development.

My Neovim configuration is completely inspired by [Josean Martinez](https://www.youtube.com/@joseanmartinez). I've customized it to suit my workflow preferences. Here are some highlights:

- **Color Scheme**: I use the [vim-moonfly](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors) color scheme for a soothing and productive coding experience.
- **Status Line**: Implemented with [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) and customized for evil mode using [evil_lualine.lua](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim/blob/master/examples/evil_lualine.lua).
- **Plugins**:
